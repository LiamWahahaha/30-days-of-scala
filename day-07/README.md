# Objects
* Key points:
  * Use objects for singletons and utility methods.
  * A cclass can have a companion object with the same name.
  * Objects can extend classes or traits.
  * The apply method of an object is usually used for constructing new instances of the companion class.
  * To avoid the main method, use an object that extends the App trait.
  * We can implement enumerations by extending the Enumeration object.
