# Class
* Key points:
  * Fields in classes automatically come with getters and setters.
  * We can replace  field with a custom getter/setter without changing th client of a class - that is th "uniform access principle."
  * Use the @BeanProperty annotation t generate the JavaBeans getXxx/setXxx methods.
  * Every class has a primmary constructor that is "interwoven" with th class definition.
    * Its parameters turn into th fields of the class.
    * The primary constructor executes all statements in th body of the class.
  * Auxiliary constructors are optional.
